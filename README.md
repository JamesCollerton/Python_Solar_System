# Python Solar System

In order to learn more about the class system and TkInter in Python I started to create a simulation of the Solar System. Originally the plan was to animate the planets under realistic gravity but that got _way_ too complicated _way_ too quickly.

The solar system is programmed with the correct planets, with the correct trajectories based on the partial differential equations of the planet orbits. The time for a rotation to be completed is based on the number of days for an orbit to take place, so should be representative of the relative planet speeds.
