# Python Solar System

In order to learn more about the class system and TkInter in Python I started to create a simulation of the Solar System. Originally the plan was to animate the planets under realistic gravity but that got _way_ too complicated _way_ too quickly.

Currently the planets are implemented with their respective masses and distances, but haven't been made to move yet. When I get some time to work on it again I will implement their motion.
